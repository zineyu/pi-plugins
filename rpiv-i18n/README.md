i18n/localization SDK for Pi extensions. Pick a UI language interactively or via flag; localize your own Pi extension with a few lines of code.

## Features

- **One shared locale dial** for every Pi extension that adopts the SDK - `/languages` switches them all at once.
- **`/languages` slash command** with an interactive picker; persists the choice to `~/.config/rpiv-i18n/locale.json` (chmod `0600`) and reports a clear error if disk persistence fails.
- **`--locale <code>` CLI flag** for one-shot or scripted launches.
- **Auto-detects** `process.env.LANG` / `LC_ALL` so most Unix users get a localized UI without configuration.
- **Tiny SDK surface for authors** - `registerStrings(namespace, byLocale)`, `scope(namespace)`, `tr(namespace, key, fallback)`. Render-time lookups, English fallback per missing key, no module-init baking.
- **Ships picker entries for** German, English, Spanish, French, Portuguese (European), Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, and Ukrainian - alphabetical by locale code (consumers contribute their own translation maps; the SDK ships infrastructure, not strings).
- **Live propagation** - locale changes via `/languages` apply to the next render with no restart, even when the SDK is loaded as multiple module instances.
- **Always-safe fallback** - if the SDK isn't installed at all, every `tr(...)` call returns the consumer's literal English fallback. Extensions stay usable.
- **Zero-import escape hatch** - `globalThis[Symbol.for("rpiv-i18n")]` exposes a frozen `{ locale, namespaces }` snapshot for tools that prefer not to depend on this package.

## For users

Install the SDK so its `/languages` command and `--locale` flag are wired into your Pi session:

```bash
pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n
```

Then restart Pi. (If you installed via `pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-pi` + `/rpiv-setup`, this is already done - `/rpiv-setup` auto-wires every sibling.)

Choose a language interactively:

```
/languages
```

Or pass a flag at startup:

```bash
pi --locale uk
```

Or edit the config file directly:

```bash
echo '{"locale":"uk"}' > ~/.config/rpiv-i18n/locale.json
```

Locale detection priority: `--locale` flag → `~/.config/rpiv-i18n/locale.json` → `process.env.LANG` / `LC_ALL` → English default. The auto-detection paths (config file, env vars) work even without this package installed - any extension that `import`s the SDK as a peer dep gets the registered locale at module init. Only the picker (`/languages`) and the flag (`--locale`) require this package to be loaded as a Pi extension.

Other Pi extensions that integrate the SDK pick up your choice automatically.

## For Pi extension authors

The SDK gives every Pi extension a single shared locale dial. Register your translations once, then look them up at render time.

### Register strings at extension load

```ts
import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";
import { registerStrings, scope } from "@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n";

const NAMESPACE = "@my-org/cool-tool";

registerStrings(NAMESPACE, {
  en: {
    "welcome": "Welcome!",
    "submit": "Submit",
  },
  uk: {
    "welcome": "Ласкаво просимо!",
    "submit": "Надіслати",
  },
});

const t = scope(NAMESPACE);

export default function (pi: ExtensionAPI) {
  pi.registerCommand("hello", {
    handler: async (_args, ctx) => {
      ctx.ui.notify(t("welcome", "Welcome!"));
    },
  });
}
```

### API

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `registerStrings(namespace, byLocale)` | Register a package's translation maps. The namespace SHOULD be your npm package name. Re-calling replaces the prior registration. |
| `scope(namespace)` | Returns a pre-bound `(key, fallback) => string` closure. |
| `tr(namespace, key, fallback)` | One-shot lookup. Returns `fallback` when the namespace or key isn't registered. |
| `getActiveLocale()` | Current locale code, or `undefined` for the English default. |
| `applyLocale(code)` | Set the active locale; rebuilds the active strings across all registered namespaces. |

### Behavior contract

- **English fallback per key.** If a key exists in `en` but not in the active locale's map, the English entry is returned. Missing-only-in-current-locale strings stay readable.
- **Always-safe fallback.** If neither this SDK nor your namespace is loaded, every `tr(...)` call returns its `fallback` literal - your extension keeps working.
- **Live locale changes.** When the user runs `/languages`, the next `tr(...)` call returns the new locale's string. No restart required.
- **Render-time only.** Call `tr(...)` at render time - never bake the result into a top-level `const X = tr(...)`. Module-init evaluation freezes the string before the user has a chance to set their locale.

## Localizing your extension - step by step

The inline example above is fine for a one-key smoke test. For a real Pi extension, use the file-based pattern that scales to dozens of strings and ten contributors. Two production exemplars in this monorepo follow this exact shape: `packages/rpiv-ask-user-question/` (questionnaire UI; bridge owns `t` + `displayLabel(kind)` for sentinel rows) and `packages/rpiv-todo/` (todo overlay + `/todos` command; bridge owns `t` + `formatStatusLabel(status)` reused across overlay and command). Read either alongside this guide.

End state on disk:

```
my-extension/
├── index.ts                  ← default export + registerStrings(...)
├── state/
│   └── i18n-bridge.ts        ← exports `t` + I18N_NAMESPACE
├── locales/
│   ├── en.json               ← canonical baseline (required)
│   ├── uk.json               ← optional additional locales
│   └── …
└── package.json              ← peerDependencies + files[] + pi.extensions
```

### 0. Declare the SDK as an OPTIONAL peer dependency

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n": "*",
    "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent": "*"
  },
  "peerDependenciesMeta": {
    "@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n": { "optional": true }
  }
}
```

Use `peerDependencies`, not `dependencies` - the user's Pi session loads one copy of the SDK; if you bundle your own, `/languages` toggles a different runtime instance and your strings never switch.

Mark it `optional: true` in `peerDependenciesMeta` so npm doesn't warn when a user installs your extension standalone without rpiv-i18n. Pair this with the dynamic-import shim shown in step 3 - your extension stays online with English-only UI when the SDK isn't installed, and lights up localization automatically when it is.

### 1. Author a `locales/en.json` next to your source

```json
{
  "_meta.notes": "English baseline. Any new key MUST land here first; other locales fall back to it.",

  "welcome.title": "Welcome",
  "submit.button": "Submit",
  "hint.cancel": "Esc to cancel"
}
```

Conventions: flat dotted lowercase keys, `snake_case` only for multi-word leaves (`hint.cancel` ✓, `hint.cancelKey` ✗). `_meta.*` keys are ignored at lookup time - use them for provenance / WIP notes.

### 2. Add a one-file bridge inside your package

`state/i18n-bridge.ts` (or wherever your package keeps cross-cutting helpers). Use a dynamic-import shim with top-level `await` so a missing peer degrades to English-only instead of failing module load:

```ts
export const I18N_NAMESPACE = "@my-org/cool-tool";

type ScopeFn = (key: string, fallback: string) => string;
type I18nSDK = { scope: (namespace: string) => ScopeFn };

let scopeImpl: ScopeFn;
try {
  const sdk = (await import("@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n")) as I18nSDK;
  scopeImpl = sdk.scope(I18N_NAMESPACE);
} catch {
  // SDK not installed - every t(key, fallback) returns the fallback verbatim.
  scopeImpl = (_key, fallback) => fallback;
}

export const t: ScopeFn = scopeImpl;
```

Every render-time call site imports `t` from this one file. If you ever switch namespaces, change the SDK, or add a `displayLabel(kind)` convenience for sentinel-row enums, you touch one place.

**Why dynamic import instead of static `import { scope } from "@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n"`?** A static ESM import is hoisted and evaluated at module load - if the SDK isn't on disk, your entire extension fails to load with `Cannot find module '@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n'`. The dynamic `await import()` inside a try/catch lets module load proceed, and the identity-fallback closure keeps your render call sites working with English. Top-level await is required because the `t` export is consumed synchronously by every render call site downstream.

### 3. Register strings at extension load

Use the same dynamic-import shim pattern as the bridge - `registerStrings` is a runtime call, so it goes inside a try/catch that no-ops when the SDK is missing:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";
import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";
import { I18N_NAMESPACE } from "./state/i18n-bridge.js";

type TranslationMap = Readonly<Record<string, string>>;
type I18nSDK = { registerStrings: (ns: string, byLocale: Record<string, TranslationMap>) => void };

function loadLocale(code: string): TranslationMap {
  // A missing/malformed locale file MUST NOT crash module init - the bridge's
  // literal English fallbacks will keep every render readable.
  try {
    return JSON.parse(
      readFileSync(fileURLToPath(new URL(`./locales/${code}.json`, import.meta.url)), "utf-8"),
    ) as TranslationMap;
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn(`@my-org/cool-tool: failed to load locales/${code}.json (${(err as Error).message})`);
    return {};
  }
}

try {
  const sdk = (await import("@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n")) as I18nSDK;
  sdk.registerStrings(I18N_NAMESPACE, {
    en: loadLocale("en"),
    // Add more as files arrive. Order doesn't matter; keys missing from a
    // non-en map fall back to en automatically.
  });
} catch {
  // SDK absent - extension still loads with English-only UI.
}

export default function (pi: ExtensionAPI): void {
  // your tool/command/hook registrations here…
}
```

`registerStrings` runs at module top-level, before Pi calls your default export. That timing is intentional - by the time the first `tr(...)` fires, every locale map is in the registry.

### 4. Use `t(key, fallback)` at the render call site

```ts
import { t } from "../state/i18n-bridge.js";

// ✓ Render-time - re-evaluated each render; live `/languages` switches apply
function renderHeader(theme) {
  return new Text(theme.bold(t("welcome.title", "Welcome")));
}

// ✗ Module-init - captured ONCE, freezes English on first load
const HEADING = t("welcome.title", "Welcome");
```

The fallback string is the canonical English literal - same one you put in `en.json`. Keep it inline at the call site so the file reads end-to-end without locale lookups, and so your extension stays usable when the SDK isn't installed at all.

### 5. Ship the locale files in `package.json`

```json
{
  "files": [
    "index.ts",
    "state/i18n-bridge.ts",
    "locales/",
    "…"
  ]
}
```

The `files[]` manifest is the #1 publish-time miss in this monorepo's history. Ship it in the same commit as the locale JSONs.

### What stays English (do NOT route through `t(...)`)

- Tool descriptions, TypeBox `description` fields, prompt guidelines / snippets - these go to the LLM. Localizing them risks the model emitting localized option labels that bypass your `RESERVED_LABEL_SET` validation.
- Validation errors that flow back through `tool result` envelopes - same reason.
- Anything checked by exact-string matching (reserved labels, dispatcher discriminants) - keep both sides in canonical English.

The recommended pattern is to keep a top-level `const X = "literal"` for the canonical English (so reserved-label checks and tests stay stable), then route the **render call site** through `t("key", X)`. The SDK never sees `X`; the LLM never sees `t(...)`.

### Optional: per-namespace `displayLabel` helper

If your extension has a small enum-typed set of "kind" rows (sentinels, statuses, modes), a one-line helper keeps render code tight:

```ts
// state/i18n-bridge.ts
import { ROW_INTENT_META, type SentinelKind } from "./row-intent.js";

export function displayLabel(kind: SentinelKind): string {
  return t(`sentinel.${kind}`, ROW_INTENT_META[kind].label);
}
```

Render code becomes `displayLabel("next")` instead of `t("sentinel.next", "Next")` - same lookup, but the canonical English fallback is sourced from the same metadata table the rest of your code uses. One source of truth per kind.

### Optional: a non-English locale file

Add `locales/uk.json` mirroring the en key set:

```json
{
  "_meta.notes": "Auto-translated draft. Native review welcome.",

  "welcome.title": "Ласкаво просимо",
  "submit.button": "Надіслати",
  "hint.cancel": "Esc - скасувати"
}
```

Wire it into `registerStrings({ en: …, uk: loadLocale("uk") })`. To make the locale show up in the `/languages` picker, add `{ code: "uk", label: "Українська" }` to `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` in this package's `i18n.ts` (open a PR, or file an issue if your extension lives outside this repo).

Done. `/languages` now switches your extension's UI alongside every other extension that adopts the SDK.

### Verify it works locally before publishing

The SDK only flips strings when it's loaded by a real Pi session - `npm test` won't catch a missing `files[]` entry or a wrong namespace. Smoke-test against a live `pi` shell:

```bash
# from your extension's directory
npm pack                                       # produces my-extension-x.y.z.tgz
pi install file:./my-extension-x.y.z.tgz       # install into your Pi session
pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n           # if not already installed
pi                                             # launch the session
> /languages                                   # pick a non-English locale
> <invoke a command/tool from your extension>  # confirm the strings flip
```

Two failure modes this catches that unit tests do not:
1. **Locale JSON not shipped** - `/languages` switches but your strings stay English. Fix: add `"locales/"` to `package.json` `files[]`.
2. **Module-init `tr(...)` capture** - picker switches, other extensions flip, yours doesn't. Fix: move the `t(...)` call inside the render function.

## Contributing translations

Want to add or improve a translation for a Pi extension that uses this SDK? Open a PR - the contract is small and uniform across packages.

### What to translate (and what NOT to)

**Translate**: every key listed in the package's `locales/en.json`. These are TUI-facing strings - labels, hints, prompts, headings - read by humans on screen.

**Do NOT translate**:
- Tool descriptions, TypeBox `description` fields, prompt guidelines, prompt snippets - they go to the LLM and stay English so the model parses them deterministically across sessions and providers.
- Validation errors that flow through `tool result` envelopes (e.g. `"Error: UI not available …"`) - same reason.
- `RESERVED_LABELS` and any keys checked by reserved-label validation - translating these lets a localized equivalent slip past the duplicate-detection guard.

If a key isn't in the package's `locales/en.json`, it's intentionally English-only. Don't invent new keys; open an issue first if you think a string should be made localizable.

### File location and naming

- One JSON file per locale, named `<code>.json` (e.g. `es.json`, `fr.json`, `pt-BR.json`), inside the consumer package's `locales/` directory.
- Locale codes follow BCP-47-ish convention: language only (`es`, `fr`, `de`) or `language-Region` for variants (`pt-BR`, `zh-CN`). Keep hyphenated, not underscored.
- Mirror the exact key set from `en.json`. Missing keys fall back to English silently - that's fine, but the `_meta.notes` field below should mention the gap.

### Key naming convention

Flat dotted lowercase: `sentinel.next`, `submit.cancel`, `preview.no_preview`. Use `snake_case` only for multi-word leaves (`preview.no_preview`, never `preview.noPreview` or `preview.no-preview`). Mixing conventions inside one file is a rejection criterion.

### File shape

```json
{
  "_meta.notes": "Optional contributor note - auto-translated, native review welcome, key gaps, etc.",

  "<dotted.key.from.en.json>": "Localized string"
}
```

`_meta.*` keys are ignored by `tr(...)` lookups (no consumer requests them). Use them for provenance, change notes, or "WIP - N keys missing".

### Universal CLI conventions (do NOT translate)

- Symbols: `↑/↓`, `⚠`, `✓` - render the same in every locale.
- Keyboard names: `Enter`, `Esc`, `Tab`, `Space` - these are the labels printed on physical keyboards worldwide. Some locales (e.g. French) write `Entrée` / `Échap`; that's acceptable when paired with the convention you're targeting (KDE/GNOME do this), but be consistent across the file.
- Single-key shortcut letters (`n` to add notes): keep the letter unchanged - it maps to a literal keystroke handler, not to a label.

### Registering the locale

After dropping the JSON file, the consumer package's `index.ts` (or wherever it calls `registerStrings`) needs the new entry:

```ts
registerStrings(I18N_NAMESPACE, {
  en: loadLocale("en"),
  es: loadLocale("es"),
  fr: loadLocale("fr"),
  "pt-BR": loadLocale("pt-BR"),
});
```

Add the locale to the `/languages` picker by appending an entry to `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` in `packages/rpiv-i18n/i18n.ts`:

```ts
{ code: "fr", label: "Français" },
```

The `label` is the locale's endonym (the language's name in itself), not its English name.

### Submitting a PR

Include:
1. The new `locales/<code>.json` file.
2. The `registerStrings(...)` update in the consumer's entry point.
3. The `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` entry in `rpiv-i18n/i18n.ts`.
4. Run `npm run check && npm test` from the monorepo root - both must pass.

A native-speaker reviewer will land it. Auto-translated drafts are accepted (mark them in `_meta.notes`); English fallbacks make any gap or error invisible to users until a fix arrives.

## globalThis introspection (escape hatch)

For tools that prefer not to import this package, the active state is also published at `globalThis[Symbol.for("rpiv-i18n")]`:

```ts
const I18N = Symbol.for("rpiv-i18n");

function lookup(key: string, fallback: string): string {
  // Re-read the symbol on every call - the SDK *replaces* the snapshot
  // (frozen object) on every registerStrings/applyLocale, so a cached
  // reference will silently serve stale strings after `/languages`.
  const state = (globalThis as { [k: symbol]: unknown })[I18N] as
    | { locale: string | undefined; namespaces: Record<string, Record<string, string>> }
    | undefined;
  return state?.namespaces["@my-org/cool-tool"]?.[key] ?? fallback;
}

lookup("welcome", "Welcome!");
```

The published object is frozen *per snapshot*, so each new locale produces a new frozen object - read the symbol at call time, never hoist it into a module-scope `const`. Registration MUST still go through `registerStrings(...)`; writing into `globalThis[I18N]` directly is unsupported.
