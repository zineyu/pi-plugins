 * defensive clears (`state-reducer.ts:104-126`) enforce mutual exclusion;
 * this type makes it explicit so per-component `focused: boolean` flags
 * derive from one equality check against this discriminant rather than
 * four parallel boolean reads.
 *
 * Priority order: notes > submit > chat > options. Matches the dispatcher
 * cascade exactly so the union is observably equivalent to today's reads.
