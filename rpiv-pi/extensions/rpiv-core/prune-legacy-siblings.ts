/**
 * Detect + remove deprecated sibling package entries from
 * ~/.pi/agent/settings.json.
 *
 * Split into two phases so /rpiv-setup can preview pending changes in the
 * confirmation dialog and apply the mutation only after the user agrees:
 *
 *   findLegacySiblings()  — read-only scan; returns the entries that WOULD
 *                           be pruned. Safe to call before confirmation.
 *   pruneLegacySiblings() — mutating apply step; rewrites settings.json.
 *                           Call only after the user has confirmed.
 *
 * Both helpers are fail-soft (missing file / invalid JSON / non-object /
 * unwritable → empty result), idempotent, and have no plugin API
 * dependency.
 *
 * Background: 0.13.x → 1.0.0 upgraders may have both nicobailon's
 * pi-subagents and @tintinweb/pi-subagents in settings.json simultaneously,
 * which makes Pi reject boot with duplicate-tool registration when both
 * load. The prune is the upgrade's must-do mutation, but it must not run
 * before the user has consented to /rpiv-setup mutating settings.json.
