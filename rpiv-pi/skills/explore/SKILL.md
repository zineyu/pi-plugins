description: Analyze solution options for a feature or change, comparing approaches with pros, cons, trade-offs, and a recommended path. Use when the user is weighing approaches, asks "what are the options" or "how should we approach X", wants approaches compared, says "explore solutions", or faces a decision with multiple valid implementations. Produces solutions documents in .rpiv/artifacts/solutions/, which can feed the design skill.

# Explore

You are tasked with analyzing solution options for new features or changes by invoking parallel skills and synthesizing their findings into actionable recommendations optimized for design consumption.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` — feature/change description, optionally with paths to tickets or research docs.

## Metadata

```!
node "${SKILL_DIR}/../_shared/now.mjs"
echo
node "${SKILL_DIR}/../_shared/git-context.mjs"
```

- `now.mjs` (line 1) — `<iso>\t<slug>` tab-separated.

Copy values verbatim — do not reformat the timezone offset.

## Flow

1. Input → 2. Generate candidates → 3. Candidate checkpoint → 4. Per-candidate fit → 5. Synthesize → 6. Metadata → 7. Write doc → 8. Present → 9. Follow-ups

The final artifact feeds design.

## Steps

### Step 1: Input Handling

1. **No argument provided** — respond with:
   ```
   I'm ready to research solution options. Please provide:
   - What feature/change you want to explore
   - Any requirements or constraints you know about
   - Reference to relevant ticket or research documents if available

   I'll analyze the current codebase, generate solution options, and provide recommendations.
   ```
   Then wait for the user's request.

2. **Read any files mentioned** — tickets, research docs, related artifacts:
   - Read them FULLY first using the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters
   - Read these files in main context before invoking skills
   - Extract requirements, constraints, and goals
   - Identify what problem we're solving

### Step 2: Generate Candidates and Dimensions

**Generate 2–4 named candidates** from three sources, then merge into one shortlist:

- **Ecosystem scan** — spawn `web-search-researcher` for any topic where the candidate space includes external libraries, frameworks, or services. Prompt it to return 2–4 named options with one-line "what it is" + canonical doc link per option. Skip only when the topic is wholly internal (e.g., "how to organize this service layer") and the orchestrator's design-space enumeration plus the user shortlist already cover the space.
- **Design-space enumeration** — orchestrator names abstract shapes from first principles when applicable (pub/sub vs direct-call vs event-bus; sync vs async; manual mapping vs auto-mapper). One-line "what it is" per shape.
- **User shortlist** — if the user pre-named candidates in the entry prompt ("compare TanStack Query vs SWR"), include those verbatim.

Merge to 2–4 candidates total. Name each with a short noun phrase ("TanStack Query", "Direct event bus"). Deduplicate.

**Default dimension list** (presented at Step 3; developer may drop irrelevant ones):

- **approach-shape** (hybrid) — what category of solution the candidate is, what core moving parts it requires.
- **precedent-fit** (codebase-anchored) — does the existing code already use this pattern; how many call sites would adopt the new option.
- **integration-risk** (codebase-anchored) — which existing seams the candidate would touch; what breaks if it lands.
- **migration-cost** (external-anchored for libraries; codebase-anchored for in-house code) — work to introduce the candidate plus work to remove the incumbent if there is one.
- **verification-cost** (codebase-anchored) — test/CI surface needed to make the candidate safe to adopt.
- **novelty** (external-anchored) — how recently the candidate emerged, ecosystem momentum, deprecation risk.

Hold the candidate set and default dimension list in working state for the Step 3 checkpoint. Do not dispatch fit agents yet.

### Step 3: Candidate Checkpoint

Present the candidate set and default dimensions to the developer before per-candidate fit dispatch.

1. **Show candidates and dimensions:**

   ```
   ## Candidates for: {Topic}

   1. {Candidate A} — {one-line what it is}
   2. {Candidate B} — {one-line what it is}
   ...

   Dimensions (default 6; drop any that don't apply):
   - approach-shape · precedent-fit · integration-risk
   - migration-cost · verification-cost · novelty
   ```

2. **Confirm via the `ask_user_question` tool with the following question:** "{N} candidates, {D} dimensions. Begin per-candidate fit dispatch?". Header: "Candidates". Options: "Proceed (Recommended)" (Begin per-candidate fit dispatch with all {N} candidates and all {D} dimensions); "Adjust candidates or dimensions" (Rename, add, or drop candidates; drop dimensions that don't apply); "Re-generate candidates" (Candidates look wrong — re-run Step 2 with adjusted scope).

3. **Handle developer input:**

   **"Proceed"**: lock the candidate × dimension set; advance to Step 4.

   **"Adjust candidates or dimensions"**: ask the follow-up free-text question with prefix `❓ Question:` — "Which candidates and dimensions should be added, dropped, or renamed?" — apply edits to the working set, re-present, and confirm again with the same three-option `ask_user_question`.

   **"Re-generate candidates"**: ask the follow-up free-text question with prefix `❓ Question:` — "What should be different in candidate generation? (narrower/wider scope, different ecosystem, exclude approach X, …)" — return to Step 2 with the updated scope, then re-enter Step 3.

   Loop until "Proceed" is selected.

### Step 4: Per-Candidate Fit Dispatch (parallel agents)

For each confirmed candidate, dispatch up to two agents in parallel — total ≤ 2 × N agents:

- **One `codebase-analyzer` per candidate** — when ≥1 kept dimension is codebase-anchored (precedent-fit, integration-risk, often migration-cost and verification-cost). The agent scores the candidate on every kept codebase-anchored dimension in a single pass, returning evidence per dimension with `file:line` references.
- **One `web-search-researcher` per candidate** — when ≥1 kept dimension is external-anchored (novelty, often migration-cost for libraries, approach-shape for ecosystem options). The agent scores the candidate on every kept external-anchored dimension in a single pass, returning evidence per dimension with doc/source links.

Skip either agent for a candidate when no dimension of that anchor-type was kept. Hybrid dimension `approach-shape` is scored by the orchestrator after both agents return, by combining their per-candidate findings.

**Per-candidate prompt shape** (use the same outer template, fill in candidate name and kept dimensions):

```
Candidate: {name} — {one-line what it is}
Topic: {topic from Step 1}

Score this single candidate on the following dimensions, each with concrete evidence ({file:line} for codebase, doc/source link for external). Report findings as one section per dimension.

Dimensions for this run:
- {dimension name} — {one-line of what to look for}
- ...

Do NOT compare against other candidates; another agent handles each one separately. Focus on depth of evidence for THIS candidate.
```

Wait for ALL agents to complete before proceeding.

**Coverage check**: every (candidate × kept-dimension) cell is filled — by an agent's evidence or by an explicit `null` ("does not apply to this candidate"). Cells silently dropped indicate a missing dispatch — re-run that candidate's agent.

### Step 5: Synthesize and Recommend

- Cross-reference per-candidate findings — fill the candidate × dimension grid with evidence per cell.
- Apply the fit filter qualitatively per candidate: a candidate "clears" when no kept dimension surfaces a blocking concern (integration-risk that breaks load-bearing seams, migration-cost that exceeds the topic's scope, verification-cost with no path to coverage).
- **If ≥1 candidate clears the fit filter**: pick the strongest, document rationale with evidence, and explain why alternatives weren't chosen. Identify conditions that would change the recommendation.
- **If every candidate fails the fit filter**: produce a "no-fit" recommendation — list each candidate's blocking dimension with evidence, recommend re-scoping the question or expanding the candidate pool, and set Step 7 frontmatter `confidence: low` and `status: blocked`.

### Step 6: Determine Metadata and Filename

Use the substituted values from the Metadata block at the top of this skill:

- Filename: `.rpiv/artifacts/solutions/<slug>_<topic>.md` — `<slug>` is the second tab-separated field on `now.mjs` line 1; `<topic>` is a brief kebab-case description.
- `repository:` ← `repo:` label; `branch:` / `commit:` ← matching labels (already include `no-branch` / `no-commit` fallbacks).
- `date:` / `last_updated:` ← `<iso>` (first tab-separated field on `now.mjs` line 1, offset verbatim).
- Author: `author:` from the Metadata block (fallback: `unknown`).

### Step 7: Generate Solutions Document

- Use the metadata gathered in step 6
- Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:

  ```markdown
  ---
  date: {Current date and time with timezone in ISO format}
  author: {Author name}
  commit: {Current commit hash}
  branch: {Current branch name}
  repository: {Repository name}
  topic: "{Feature/Problem}"
  confidence: high | medium | low
  complexity: low | medium | high
  status: ready | awaiting_input | blocked
  tags: [solutions, component-names]
  last_updated: {Same ISO timestamp as `date:` above}
  last_updated_by: {Author name}
  ---

  ## Recommendation

  <!-- Render exactly ONE of the two blocks below, based on Step 5's fit-filter outcome. -->

  **(A) When ≥1 candidate clears the fit filter:**

  **Selected:** {Option N}

  **Rationale:**
  - {Key reason with evidence}
  - {Key reason with evidence}
  - ...

  **Why not alternatives:**
  - Option X: {Reason}

  **Trade-offs:**
  - Accepting {limitation} for {benefit}

  **Implementation approach:**

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - {Pattern}: `file.ext:line`

  **Risks:**
  - {Risk}: {Mitigation}

  **(B) When every candidate fails the fit filter:**

  **No-fit:** every candidate surfaced a blocking concern on at least one kept dimension.

  **Per-candidate blockers:**
  - {Option 1}: {blocking dimension} — {evidence with file:line or doc link}
  - {Option 2}: {blocking dimension} — {evidence}
  - ...

  **Recommended next step:**

  - [ ] ...

  ## Open Questions
  **Resolved during research:**

  ## References

  - `.rpiv/artifacts/research/{file}.md` - {Context}
  - `src/file.ext:line` - {Similar implementation}
  - `.rpiv/artifacts/{file}.md` - {Historical decision}
  ```

### Step 8: Present Findings

Print a concise summary, highlight key integration points, then close with the standardized footer:

```
Solutions document written to:
`.rpiv/artifacts/solutions/{filename}.md`

{N} candidates evaluated, {M} dimensions scored, recommendation: {chosen}.

---

💬 Follow-up: describe the change in chat to append a timestamped Follow-up section to this artifact. Re-run `/skill:explore` for a fresh artifact.

**Next step:** `/skill:design .rpiv/artifacts/solutions/{filename}.md` — turn the chosen option into a design artifact (or `/skill:blueprint .rpiv/artifacts/solutions/{filename}.md` for the fast path on smaller tasks).

> 🆕 Tip: start a fresh session with `/new` first — chained skills work best with a clean context window.
```

### Step 9: Handle Follow-ups

- **Append, never rewrite.** Edit the artifact to add a `## Follow-up Analysis {ISO 8601 timestamp}` section. Prior candidate scoring and verdicts stay immutable.
- **Bump frontmatter.** Update `last_updated` + `last_updated_by`; set `last_updated_note: "<one-line summary of follow-up>"`.
- **Re-dispatch narrowly.** Spawn ≤1–2 fresh agents scoped to the new candidate or dimension. Do NOT re-run the full skill.
- **When to re-invoke instead.** If the candidate set or dimensions shift materially, re-run `/skill:explore` for a fresh artifact. The previous block's `Next step:` stays valid for the existing artifact.

## Important Notes

- Parallel Agent dispatch — every `Agent(...)` call in the same assistant message (multiple tool_use blocks in one response), never one per turn. Call shape: `Agent({ subagent_type: "<agent-name>", description: "<3-5 word task label>", prompt: "<task>" })`.
- Always spawn fresh research to validate current state - never rely on old research docs as source of truth
- Old research documents can provide historical context but must be validated against current code
- Generate 2-4 named candidates in Step 2; confirm them with the developer at Step 3 before per-candidate fit dispatch
- Web-search-researcher is a first-class Step 2 agent for ecosystem candidate-source — skip only when the topic is wholly internal and design-space enumeration plus user shortlist cover the space
- Per-candidate fit dispatch caps at two agents per candidate (one codebase-analyzer, one web-search-researcher) — skip either when no dimension of its anchor-type was kept
- Solutions documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Each agent prompt should be specific and focused on a single candidate scored on the kept dimensions
- Quantify pattern precedent — count usage in codebase, don't just say "follows pattern"
- Ground complexity estimates in actual similar work from git history
- Think like a software architect — option-shopping output is 2–4 comparable candidates plus an honest fit verdict
- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis and comparison, not deep implementation details
- Encourage agents to find existing patterns and examples, not just describe possibilities
- Resolve technical unknowns during research — don't leave critical questions for design
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before invoking skills
- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly
  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before invoking skills (step 1)
  - ALWAYS generate candidates and run the Step 3 checkpoint before per-candidate dispatch (steps 2 → 3 → 4)
  - ALWAYS wait for all per-candidate agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)
  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 6 before step 7)
  - NEVER write the solutions document with placeholder values
