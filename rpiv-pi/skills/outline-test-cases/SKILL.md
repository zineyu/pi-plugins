# Outline Test Cases

You are tasked with discovering all testable features in a project and creating a folder outline under `.rpiv/test-cases/`. Each feature gets its own folder with a `_meta.md` file containing discovered routes, endpoints, scope decisions, and domain context. A root `README.md` summarizes the full project outline. No test case content is generated — use `write-test-cases` per feature to fill the folders.

Two modes: **Fresh** (no existing outline — full discovery and checkpoint) and **Incremental** (existing outline found — discovery with prior context, diff-based checkpoint). Discovery always runs in both modes.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` — optional target directory. Defaults to the current working directory.

## Metadata

```!
node "${SKILL_DIR}/../_shared/now.mjs"
```

`now.mjs` (line 1) — `<iso>\t<slug>` tab-separated. Use `<iso>` for any `date:` frontmatter bump; copy verbatim.

## Flow

1. Input → 2. Discover features → 3. Determine targets → 4. Checkpoint → 5. Write outline → 6. Follow-ups

## Steps

### Step 1: Input Handling and Mode Detection

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'll discover all testable features in this project and create a folder outline
under .rpiv/test-cases/. Let me check for existing outlines and analyze the codebase.
```

Use the current working directory as the target project by default. If the user provides a specific directory path as an argument, use that instead.

- If the user mentions specific files (existing test cases, architecture docs, READMEs), read them FULLY first
- **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
- **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before invoking any agents

#### Mode Detection

Check for existing outline data:

1. **Glob** for `**/_meta.md` with path set to `.rpiv/test-cases/` in the target directory (dot-prefixed directories must be targeted directly)
2. If no `_meta.md` files found → **Fresh mode**. Proceed to Step 2.
3. If `_meta.md` files found → **Incremental mode**. Read them ALL and extract:
   - Existing feature list (names, slugs, modules, routes, endpoints)
   - Scope exclusions from `## Scope Decisions` sections
   - Previous checkpoint Q&A from `## Checkpoint History` sections
   - Generated date from frontmatter

Report detected mode:
```
[Fresh]: No existing outline found. Will run full discovery.
[Incremental]: Found {N} existing feature outlines from {generated date}. Will re-discover with prior context and highlight changes.
```

### Step 2: Discover features

First, detect the project's technology stack by checking for framework indicators (see Framework Detection Reference below).

Spawn the following agents in parallel using the Agent tool. Wait for ALL agents to complete before proceeding.
- Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all registered routes, navigation menus, and page entry points
- Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all frontend HTTP API call sites — report each call-site `file:line` and the literal URL template string found at the call site (e.g., ``${base}/users/${id}``). Frontend-to-backend URL correlation happens orchestrator-side in Step 3's Cross-Reference synthesis (`skills/outline-test-cases/SKILL.md:71-79`) using the backend-controller findings from the next agent.
- Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all backend API controllers and route handlers
- Use the **test-case-locator** agent to find existing test cases in `.rpiv/test-cases/` to avoid duplicates

Include in your prompts for the three codebase-locator agents:
- Target directory and detected framework
- In **Incremental mode**: summary of previously discovered features (names, routes, endpoints) from existing `_meta.md` files — ask agents to flag new items and note any that no longer exist
- If **scope exclusions** were loaded in Step 1: list them and instruct agents to exclude matching results

While agents run, read `.gitignore` yourself to understand exclusion rules.

### Step 3: Determine feature targets

**IMPORTANT**: Wait for ALL agents from Step 2 to complete before proceeding.

#### Cross-Reference (both modes)

Cross-reference findings from all 4 agents:

**Feature identification** — Build the feature list from frontend evidence:
1. Start with frontend routes (Route Discovery) — each top-level route group is a candidate feature
2. Validate with navigation menus — features in the sidebar/nav are confirmed active
3. Enrich with API call mapping (API Mapping) — link each feature's frontend services to backend endpoints
4. Cross-reference against backend controllers (Backend Discovery) — identify which backend controllers serve each frontend feature

**Phantom detection** — Flag backend controllers NOT referenced by any frontend route or API call:
- Platform/public API controllers serving external consumers
- Webhook controllers triggered by external services
- Deprecated endpoints with code still present
- Sub-services used within other features
- Present these as "Backend-only endpoints (no frontend exposure)" in the confirmation

#### Incremental: Diff Against Existing Outline

In Incremental mode, compare the fresh discovery results against existing `_meta.md` data and classify each feature:

| Category | Condition |
|---|---|
| **Unchanged** | Feature exists in both existing outline and fresh discovery, routes/endpoints match |
| **New** | Found by agents but not in any existing `_meta.md` |
| **Removed** | In existing `_meta.md` but not found by agents |
| **Changed** | Feature exists in both but routes or endpoints differ |

#### Common Processing (both modes)

**Feature grouping** — Group confirmed features by portal/application:
- Detected from route structure (e.g., Admin, Public, Partner, Host)

**Decomposition rules:**
- Large features (>10 endpoints or >3 sub-routes) — note sub-features in metadata, keep as single folder
- Small features (<5 endpoints, no dedicated route) — fold into parent feature
- Sub-services without own routes — fold into the feature that uses them

**Slug and module assignment:**
- Feature slug: kebab-case from feature name (e.g., `user-management` → `users`, `report-builder`)
- Module abbreviation: short uppercase code derived from feature name (e.g., USR, AUTH, DASH, RPT)

**Duplicate check** — Cross-reference against existing TCs (TC Locator):
- Features with existing TC folders → mark status as "partial" (has outline, TCs may exist)
- Features with no TCs → mark status as "pending"

### Step 4: Developer checkpoint

#### Fresh Mode — Full Checkpoint

Ask grounded questions one at a time before presenting the feature list. Use a **❓ Question:** prefix so the user knows their input is needed. Each question must reference real findings and pull NEW information — not confirm what you already found. Ask several questions targeting what the code analysis could not detect.

**Question focus areas** (business/product language first, technical fallback only when necessary):

- **Phantom features**: "There's a bulk-import capability in the code but no screen for it in the admin panel — is this tested separately or internal-only?"
- **Missing coverage**: "The navigation menu shows a Reports section but I can't find an actual page behind it — is this under development or was it removed?"
- **Hidden features**: "I see three separate user management areas but only one is visible in the menu — are the others internal tools or deprecated?"
- **Feature boundaries**: "User management and role assignment share the same backend — should they be one test area or two?"
- **Environment-specific**: "Some features seem to be behind feature flags and only active in staging — should these be included in the test outline?"

**CRITICAL**: Ask ONE question at a time. Wait for the answer before asking the next. Lead with your most significant finding.

**Choosing question format:**

- **`ask_user_question` tool** — when your question has 2-4 concrete options from code analysis (pattern conflicts, integration choices, scope boundaries, priority overrides). The user can always pick "Other" for free-text. Example: Use the `ask_user_question` tool with the question "Found 2 mapping approaches — which should new code follow?". Options: "Manual mapping (Recommended)" (Used in OrderService (src/services/OrderService.ts:45) — 8 occurrences); "AutoMapper" (Used in UserService (src/services/UserService.ts:12) — 2 occurrences).

- **Free-text with ❓ Question: prefix** — when the question is open-ended and options can't be predicted (discovery, "what am I missing?", corrections). Example:
  "❓ Question: Integration scanner found no background job registration for this area. Is that expected, or is there async processing I'm not seeing?"

**Batching**: When you have 2-4 independent questions (answers don't depend on each other), you MAY batch them in a single `ask_user_question` call. Keep dependent questions sequential.

**Classify each response and track for persistence:**

**Confirmations** ("looks good", "yes proceed"):
- Record. Proceed to the next question, or to the feature list if all questions answered.

**Corrections** ("that's deprecated", "wrong grouping"):
- Update the feature list directly. Record as scope decision for the affected feature.

**Additions** ("you missed the refund flow", "add platform API"):
- Add to the feature list. Assign slug/module. Record as scope decision.

**Scope adjustments** ("skip admin features", "split settings into two"):
- Adjust the target list. Record as scope decision for affected features.

After all questions are answered, present the proposed feature list:

```
## Proposed Feature Outline

Framework detected: {framework name}
Applications found: {N} ({app names})
Total backend endpoints: ~{N} across {M} controllers

---
### {Portal Name} ({N} features)

1. {Feature Name} — {N} routes, {M} API endpoints
   Slug: {feature-slug} | Module: {MOD}
   Sub-features: {list if decomposed, or "none"}
2. {Feature Name} — {N} routes, {M} API endpoints
   Slug: {feature-slug} | Module: {MOD}
{etc.}

### Already Covered (will skip):
- {Feature} — {N} existing TCs in .rpiv/test-cases/{slug}/

### Backend-Only Endpoints (no frontend exposure):
- {Controller/endpoint group} — {reason: platform API / webhook / deprecated}

---
Create outline for {total} features?
```

Use the `ask_user_question` tool with the following question: "Create outline for {total} features across {N} portals?". Options: "Create outline (Recommended)" (Write _meta.md files and folder structure for all features above); "Add or remove features" (Adjust the feature list before creating); "Reclassify" (Move backend-only endpoints into the main feature list or vice versa).

Handle any final additions, removals, reclassifications, or slug/module overrides.

#### Incremental Mode — Diff-Based Checkpoint

Present the diff results from Step 3 with previous decisions:

```
## Outline Update ({N} features, last run {generated date})

Unchanged ({N}):
- {Feature Name} — {slug} | {MOD}
{etc.}

New ({N}):
- {Feature Name} — {N} routes, {M} API endpoints (not in previous outline)
{etc.}

Removed ({N}):
- {Feature Name} — was {slug} | {MOD} (no longer found in codebase)
{etc.}

Changed ({N}):
- {Feature Name} — {what changed: "3 new endpoints", "route path changed", etc.}
{etc.}

Previous decisions:
- {Q&A pair 1 rephrased as single-line decision statement}
- {Q&A pair 2 rephrased as single-line decision statement}

```

Use the `ask_user_question` tool with the following question: "{N} unchanged, {M} new, {K} removed features. Apply updates?". Options: "Apply updates (Recommended)" (Update _meta.md files and create new feature folders); "Adjust changes" (Modify the proposed new/removed/changed features); "Re-run discovery" (Something looks wrong — re-scan the codebase).

Rephrase each Q&A pair into a concise decision statement (e.g., `**Q:** "Is the bulk-import capability tested separately?" **A:** "No, internal only"` becomes `"Bulk-import — internal only, excluded from scope"`).

**If no changes detected** (all features unchanged):
- Present the unchanged list and previous decisions
- Use the `ask_user_question` tool with the following question: "No changes detected since {date}. Still accurate?". Options: "Confirmed" (Outline is still accurate — no updates needed); "Force re-scan" (Re-run discovery anyway to verify).

**For new/changed/removed features**, ask grounded questions ONE at a time (same approach as Fresh mode) targeting only the differences. Unchanged features need only batch confirmation.

**Classify each response and track for persistence** (same as Fresh mode: Confirmations, Corrections, Additions, Scope adjustments).

After all questions are answered, present the full feature list summary (same format as Fresh mode) and wait for user confirmation before proceeding to Step 5.

### Step 5: Write folder outline

#### Fresh Mode — creating new files

1. **Create directories** — for each confirmed feature, create `.rpiv/test-cases/{feature-slug}/`

2. **Write `_meta.md` per feature** — one file per folder:

   Read the full feature metadata template at `templates/feature-meta.md`. Follow the template exactly, populating fields from agent findings and checkpoint answers:
   - `## Routes` — route paths and component names from Route Discovery (no file:line references)
   - `## Endpoints` — HTTP methods and paths from Backend Discovery
   - `## Scope Decisions` — from checkpoint answers classified as Corrections, Additions, or Scope adjustments that affect this feature. Include cross-cutting decisions that apply. If no scope decisions surfaced, write a default entry: `- Full feature in scope (no exclusions identified)`
   - `## Domain Context` — from checkpoint answers that reveal business rules or intentional behaviors. Leave section with `- None identified` if nothing surfaced.
   - `## Test Data Requirements` — from checkpoint answers that mention data needs. Leave section with `- None identified` if nothing surfaced.
   - `## Checkpoint History` — all Q&A pairs from the checkpoint that affect this feature, under a date header (`### YYYY-MM-DD`)

3. **Write root `README.md`** at `.rpiv/test-cases/README.md`:

   Read the full outline README template at `templates/outline-readme.md`. Follow the template exactly, populating fields from the confirmed feature list.

4. **Present summary:**
   ```
   ## Test Case Outline Created

   | Folder | Module | Portal | Routes | Endpoints | Status |
   |--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
   | users/ | USR | Admin | 5 | 20 | pending |
   | reports/ | RPT | Admin | 2 | 15 | pending |
   | {etc.} | | | | | |

   Output: `.rpiv/test-cases/`
   Total: {N} feature folders + {N} _meta.md files + 1 README.md
   Phantom features skipped: {list or "none"}

   Note: this outline is a starting point based on code analysis — re-run or add features manually as the project evolves.

   ---

   💬 Follow-up: describe folder/metadata changes in chat to update specific `_meta.md` files. Re-run `/skill:outline-test-cases` for incremental discovery against the current codebase.

   **Next step:** `/skill:write-test-cases [feature-name]` — generate the test case files for a single feature (run once per feature folder).

   > 🆕 Tip: start a fresh session with `/new` first — chained skills work best with a clean context window.
   ```

#### Incremental Mode — updating existing files

1. **Update existing `_meta.md` files** using the Edit tool:
   - Update `## Routes` and `## Endpoints` with fresh discovery data
   - Append new Q&A pairs to `## Checkpoint History` under a new date header (`### YYYY-MM-DD`)
   - Update `## Scope Decisions` if changed during checkpoint
   - Update `## Domain Context` if changed
   - Update frontmatter `date` to `<iso>` from the Metadata block (first tab-separated field on `now.mjs` line 1)

2. **Add new feature folders** for newly discovered features:
   - Create directory + write new `_meta.md` from template (same as Fresh mode Step 5.2)

3. **Flag removed features** — do NOT delete folders (they may contain generated TCs):
   - Update `_meta.md` frontmatter `status` to `removed`
   - Append removal note to `## Checkpoint History`
   - Inform the user which folders were flagged so they can decide whether to delete

4. **Update root `README.md`** — update feature table and `Last updated:` line using Edit

5. **Present summary:**
   ```
   ## Test Case Outline Updated

   Unchanged: {N} features
   Updated: {N} _meta.md files (routes/endpoints refreshed)
   Added: {N} new feature folders
   Removed: {N} features flagged (folders preserved)

   Changes:
   - {List of what changed: "Added payments feature", "Flagged legacy-reports as removed", "Updated scope for users", etc.}

   Output: `.rpiv/test-cases/`

   Note: this outline is a starting point based on code analysis — re-run or add features manually as the project evolves.

   ---

   💬 Follow-up: describe folder/metadata changes in chat to update specific `_meta.md` files. Re-run `/skill:outline-test-cases` for incremental discovery against the current codebase.

   **Next step:** `/skill:write-test-cases [feature-name]` — generate the test case files for a single feature (run once per feature folder).

   > 🆕 Tip: start a fresh session with `/new` first — chained skills work best with a clean context window.
   ```

### Step 6: Handle Follow-ups

- **Append, never rewrite.** Edit `_meta.md` files in place; do not delete folders that contain generated TCs (flag them via `status: removed` instead).
- **Bump frontmatter.** Update each touched `_meta.md`'s `date` field and the root `README.md` `Last updated:` line to `<iso>` from the Metadata block.
- **Re-dispatch narrowly.** Spawn ≤1–2 agents scoped to the changed feature. Do NOT re-run the full skill.
- **When to re-invoke instead.** If the codebase changed significantly, re-run `/skill:outline-test-cases` — incremental mode auto-detects existing outlines and reconciles. The previous block's `Next step:` stays valid.

Skill-specific verbs:
- **Add features**: add folder + `_meta.md`, update `README.md`.
- **Remove features**: tell the user they can delete the folder; update `README.md`.
- **Reclassify phantoms**: create folder + `_meta.md` for the reclassified feature, update `README.md`.
- **Adjust metadata**: edit specific `_meta.md` files using the Edit tool.

## Important Notes

- This skill creates folders and `_meta.md` only — use `write-test-cases` per feature for actual TC content.
- Frontend routes define features; backend enriches them. No UI route → no folder (unless developer overrides).
- Never skip the developer checkpoint, even on incremental runs.
- `_meta.md` is the inter-skill contract — keep route/endpoint paths stable, no `file:line` references.
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before invoking agents.
- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly.
  - ALWAYS detect mode first (Step 1) before spawning agents
  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before invoking agents (Step 1)
  - ALWAYS wait for all agents to complete before determining targets (Step 3)
  - ALWAYS checkpoint with the user before presenting the feature list (Step 4)
  - ALWAYS get user confirmation before writing folders (Step 4 → Step 5)
  - NEVER write folders or metadata with placeholder values
- **Duplicate avoidance**: Always check existing TCs via test-case-locator before creating folders.
- **Idempotent re-runs**: If `.rpiv/test-cases/` already has folders with TCs, mark them accordingly — do not overwrite existing TC content. Only update `_meta.md` and `README.md`.
