## [1.10.2] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-19

## [1.9.2] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Adding a translated locale no longer requires editing the extension entry — drop `locales/<code>.json` next to the existing files and it loads automatically on next start.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-07

## [1.1.5] - 2026-05-05

### Changed
- Overlay UX: completed todo items now stay visible until the next agent response starts, then disappear from later overlay renders. Replay-driven lifecycle events (`session_start`, `session_compact`, `session_tree`) reset that per-overlay display memory so replayed completed items can be shown once again.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Localized TUI chrome (overlay heading, `/todos` section headers, status words) via `@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n`. 8 locales out of the box (de, en, es, fr, pt, pt-BR, ru, uk). LLM-facing strings (response envelope, reducer errors) stay English.

### Changed
- `@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n` is now a soft optional peer (`peerDependenciesMeta.optional: true`). The bridge and module-init `registerStrings` call use a dynamic `await import()` inside try/catch, so a standalone install of just `rpiv-todo` no longer fails with `Cannot find module '@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n'` — the extension stays online with English-only UI when the SDK isn't present, and lights up localization automatically when it is.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-05-03

## [1.1.2] - 2026-05-03

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-03

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-03

## [1.0.19] - 2026-05-03

## [1.0.18] - 2026-05-02

## [1.0.17] - 2026-05-02

## [1.0.16] - 2026-05-02

## [1.0.15] - 2026-05-02

## [1.0.14] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- Cover redesigned as a macOS-style terminal-window screenshot mimicking the real `Todos (2/7)` overlay.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- `docs/vertical-cover.{svg,png}` — portrait-orientation hero artwork (1280×800 canvas; PNG downscaled to 320×711).

### Changed
- Cover canvas extended from 1280×640 to 1280×800 with refreshed crop marks/footer.
- README hero swapped from `docs/cover.png` to `docs/vertical-cover.png`, rendered at `width="160"`. The `<a>` wrapper around the `<picture>` was removed so the image is no longer a clickable link to the package directory.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- `docs/cover.png` — package hero (rasterized from `docs/cover.svg` via `rsvg-convert`, 1280×640).

### Changed
- README hero: open with a `<picture>`-wrapped `cover.png` above the shield badges so pi.dev's package-card image extractor picks the friendly artwork instead of the npm version shield. Existing `docs/overlay.jpg` screenshot retained below the description.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- Internal refactor: `todo.ts` split into layered modules under `state/`, `tool/`, and `view/`. The reducer, store, replay, task-graph, response envelope, schema, and view formatters each live in their own file; `todo.ts` is now a thin registration shell that re-exports the pre-refactor public surface so `index.ts`, the overlay, and existing tests keep importing from `./todo.js`. `package.json` `files` array updated to ship the new modules (16 production files in the tarball).
- README rewritten with a user-outcome opener and a new `## Features` section (live overlay, survives `/reload` and compaction, status states, dependency tracking with cycle detection, smart truncation). `package.json` `description` synced.

### Added
- `ship-manifest.test.ts` — verifies `package.json` `files` covers every production `.ts` module across the package tree, so future module additions can't silently fall out of the npm tarball.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-20

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Testability exports: `__resetState()` resets module-level `tasks` + `nextId` to their initial state; `getNextId()` exposes the current id counter alongside existing `getTodos()`. Follows the sibling reset convention (`invalidateSkillIndex`, `clearInjectionState`) used elsewhere in the monorepo. Production behaviour unchanged.
- Canonical reducer + replay test suites (`todo.reducer.test.ts`, `todo.replay.test.ts`) validating the full Vitest harness shape for downstream packages to follow.

### Changed
- Consolidated into the `juicesharp/rpiv-mono` monorepo. Version aligned to the rpiv-pi family lockstep starting point. No runtime behavior change from `0.1.2`.
