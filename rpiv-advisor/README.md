Let the model ask a stronger model for a second opinion before it acts. `rpiv-advisor` adds the `advisor` tool and `/advisor` slash command to [Pi Agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) - the working model can hand the full conversation to a reviewer (e.g. Opus) and resume with its plan, correction, or stop signal.

## Features

- **Reviewer model selector** - `/advisor` opens a picker over any model in Pi's registry, plus a reasoning-effort picker for reasoning-capable models.
- **Persisted across sessions** - selection saved at `~/.config/rpiv-advisor/advisor.json` (chmod 0600).
- **Off by default** - the `advisor` tool is excluded until you pick a model; choose "No advisor" to disable.
- **Per-executor blocklist** - list executor models in `disabledForModels` (in `advisor.json`) to strip the `advisor` tool when those models drive the session. Entries can be plain strings (block at any effort) or `{ "model": "<provider:id>", "minEffort": "<level>" }` to block only when the executor's effort meets or exceeds the threshold. Available levels, lowest to highest: `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`.
- **Zero-parameter handoff** - calling `advisor` forwards the full serialized conversation branch; no manual prompt needed.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-advisor
```

Then restart your Pi session.

## Usage

Configure an advisor model with `/advisor` - the command opens a selector for
any model registered with Pi's model registry, plus a reasoning-effort picker
for reasoning-capable models. Selection persists across sessions at
`~/.config/rpiv-advisor/advisor.json` (chmod 0600).

The `advisor` tool is registered at load but excluded from active tools by
default; selecting a model via `/advisor` enables it. Choose "No advisor" to
disable.

`advisor` takes zero parameters - calling it forwards the full serialized
conversation branch to the advisor model, which returns guidance (plan,
correction, or stop signal) that the executor consumes.

## Tool

- **`advisor`** - escalate the current conversation branch to the configured reviewer model. Inactive until a model is selected via `/advisor`.

### Schema

```ts
advisor() // zero parameters
```

The full conversation branch is auto-serialized from `ctx.sessionManager` - the LLM does not (and cannot) pass it explicitly.

Returns:

```ts
{
  content: [{ type: "text", text: string }], // reviewer's guidance, or error message
  details: {
    advisorModel?: string,        // "<provider>:<modelId>"
    effort?: ThinkingLevel,       // reasoning effort, when applicable
    usage?: Usage,                // token usage from the side-call
    stopReason?: StopReason,      // pi-ai stop reason
    errorMessage?: string,        // populated on auth/abort/error/empty paths
  }
}
```
